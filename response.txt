1. Describe the difference between an `Array` and a `LinkedList`.

-Array:
    *save this elems into a continus memory locaion
    *faster to access to an element by index
    *fixed size - hard to add/remove elems
    *memory use at compile time

-LinkedList
    *save this elems into a NOT continus memory locaion
    *slower to access to an element by 'next' pointers
    *not fixed size - easy to add/remove elems
    *memory use at run time
    *use more memory because 'val' and 'next' fields
